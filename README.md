# Work Day Scheduler

This project is a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am-5pm). The application is built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery, and it utilizes the Day.js library to work with date and time in the browser.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am-5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Functionality

The application meets the user story and acceptance criteria by providing the following functionality:

- The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
- The time blocks for standard business hours (9am-5pm) are presented as rows.
- Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
- Clicking on a time block allows the user to enter an event.
- Clicking the save button for a time block saves the event text in local storage.
- The saved events persist even after refreshing the page.
